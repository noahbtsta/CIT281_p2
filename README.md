# Project 2

I gained more experience with the CLI as well as creating a git repository (repo). I also got
more practice refactoring javascript code on VS Code. 

### Skills Used in Project
- Created a subfolder on my CIT281 class folder called refactor
- Added files to folder and commited to git
- Created functions on JS such as:
-
      - getRandomLetter()
      - getRandomString(minLength, maxLength)
      - getRandomInteger() 
      - getSortedString(string)



- Used ping to determine if a specific internet location is available
